# CustomBowDings
A collection of custom successful bow hit resource packs.
These are designed for use in Minecraft Java version 1.19.4.
Just add the folder(s) of your choice from the .zip to the resource pack folder and they should work.
I do not claim to own any sounds or images included in these resource packs.
